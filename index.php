					<strong>Craftery Jewellery </strong>is based in Dublin and offers a range of hand crafted jewellery. The collection offers bracelets, necklaces, earrings. I also offer a service to create custom made pieces of jewellery to complete an outfit or as a special gift. 
					</p>

					<p>Please take some time to have a look around the site. If there are any pieces you are interested in buying you can email me at caitriona@craftery.ie. Please provide the reference number of the piece you like in your message.
					</p>

					<p>
					If you'd like see my pieces before buying you can find me at markets around Dublin. I keep the news box updated with details of the markets I'll be at.
					</p>
					<p>
					You can also find me on Facebook and visit my shop on Etsy. 
					</p>

					<p>
					Please come back to the site regularly to see what jewellery I'm working on.
